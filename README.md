# SeedSorter

SeedSorter is a package that facilitates the use of supervised and unsupervised
classification algorithms to discriminate between seeds and non-seed plant particles
that have been sorted with an Union Biometrica Biosorter large particle flow cytometer.

## Installation

SeedSorter is not registered, so in order to download it and install, please type
the following code into an R session:

```
devtools::install_github(repo = "AleMorales/SeedSorter")
```

## Documentation

For a real life example of the use of SeedSorter see https://github.com/AleMorales/SeedSorterPaper, which contains the raw data and
R scripts behind the paper "A high throughput method for quantifying number and size distribution of *Arabidopsis* seeds using large particle flow cytometry" by Morales
et al. (currently under review).
